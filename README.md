Android application created for my bachelor's thesis __'Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor Data Retrieval and Database Insertion'__.

_Thesis abstract:_

Hypertension is one of the most disturbing health issues nowadays as it can result in many
dangerous diseases and even death. In order to keep the symptoms of hypertension under
control, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and the results sent to a doctor who would
then analyze them. Wireless blood pressure monitor is the best mean to measure one’s blood
pressure systematically, because it is more compact and convenient to use than wired monitors.

The main aim of this bachelor’s thesis is to create a mobile application that automates the
process of retrieving data from a wireless blood pressure monitor and sends it to the patient’s
physician. For the purpose of testing and demonstrating full functionality of the application, a
web application was developed that would receive the data sent from the blood pressure monitor
and add it to a database.

It is hoped that the software suite created in the scope of this thesis will serve as a base of a
similar solution that would be further developed by the state of Estonia. Such a solution has the
potential to improve treatment of different diseases, and hence the well-being and the health of
the Estonian nation.
